ActsAsEaut
==========

Author: Jesse Clark, jesse at jesseclark.com

This plugin is pretty much a pluginized port of Michael Richardson's python EAUT library.

Briefly, EAUT is an open protocol to allow standard email addresses to be transformed into URLs for services like OpenID.

For more info see: http://eaut.org/

To install run:

script/plugin install http://eaut.googlecode.com/svn/code/rails/trunk/acts_as_eaut


Example
=======

	# get_openid_for_email( url ) is the only method you need to call.
  include Acts::Eaut
  
  acts_as_eaut

   def authenticate_open_id
     params[:openid_url] = get_openid_for_email(params[:openid_url]) if params[:openid_url].include?('@')
     verify_open_id
   end
